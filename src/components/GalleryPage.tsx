      biography: `Isaac Olamide Samson serves as the Hausa representative for God Will Provide Outreach Ministry.

      biography: `Evangelist Jones is a member of Christian Missionary Baptist Church family in 1998 under Bishop Henry W. and 1st Lady Pauline White's leadership. Bishop White acknowledged the call to ministry on my life in 2004, which I confirmed.  I humbled myself to that call and my first assignment was to evangelize outside the four walls. We organized Bible Study classes at the Adult Care Home, and the Homeless Shelter (Atlanta Union Mission), where we also implemented a mobile GED program using volunteer tutors. Here we witnessed that many had not accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.  
I had a burning desire to share Jesus, and I couldn't get enough of reading the Bible, and sharing with others. The Holy Spirit is still teaching and guiding me. God established my ministry which is God Will Provide. I was ordained in the office of Evangelist/Pastor, ministering to my family first and to whomever God sent to become a part of the congregation. Some have set under this ministry, because they wanted the intimacy of a small congregation.  I love teaching the word, and God allowed me to earn my doctorate in Divinity.  But like I said, the Holy Spirit is the real Teacher.
Since 2016, I've added a CD "The Gospel" to help with the outreach to evangelize the World. This CD is a Spoken Word simply planting seeds on how to be saved and why to be saved. It is intentionally placed to be heard in secular genres.  We pay a fee to Radio Airplay for the airtime, and our goal is to reach as many people as possible to come to Christ.  Since 2024, we have extended this opportunity to anyone who wants to help financially or by soliciting donors to help with this very important mission of seeking souls to be saved. 
I praise God for His faithfulness, and I honor Bishop Henry White and 1st Lady Pauline for their guidance.  I am grateful for my family, friends, tutors, volunteers, God Will Provide, Pure Gold Gospel Singers, and the passionate Artists that narrated the Gospel CD in their own respective languages. I acknowledge Singer/Musician Elizabeth Olaitan, and Website Developer Adeola Ilavbare (awesome website) to help bring this mission work to fruition. Hallelujah!`,
